        <h3>containerization with docker</h3>
          a major goal of this project was for the "end" product to be as maintainable and 
          replicable as possible. this was achieved by running each component of the system in 
          individual, lightweight, and highly specialized 
          <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-docker" target="blank">docker</a> 
          containers. this architecture promotes separation of concerns, keeps each environment 
          independent and uncluttered, and allows for quick & easy startup/teardown

        <h3>http server/api</h3> 
          every interaction with jdeko.me is handled via a handwritten 
          http server & api in go (formerly golang). this go application
          runs in its own indpenedent environment via docker.<br>
          docker networking is utilized and configured via docker compose to allow 
          for communicaton between the api & database
